The building block of a Go Program is package.

Every Go Program starts with `package main` declaration

```
package main
```

Packages can be imported to a Go program with `import` declaration:

```
import "fmt"
```

Every Go program has a main function declaration. It is the entry point of a Go program.

```
func main() {
   fmt.Println("Hello, World!")
}
```
